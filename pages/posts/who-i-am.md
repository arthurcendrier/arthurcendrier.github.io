Hi there!

You need a modern and elegant website to drive more traffic to your business? That's where I come in! With my design and development skills, I'll help you build a website that achieves all your objectives. Thanks to a clear and transparent workflow you'll be able to follow and validate my work every step of the way, ensuring that you get exactly what you want!

After graduating from Epitech with a five year degree in Information Technology and dabbling in independent video game development for a while, I decided to specialize in web designing and development.
During the span of my studies, I gathered a total of twenty months of work experience in internships and spent one year abroad at Chung Ang University in Seoul!

I have a large number of interests and always enjoy learning new skills. I speak English and French and live in France (that's the CEST timezone).
